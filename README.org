The builtin orgmode package for viewing tasks or events for a
particular day, org-agenda, does not help you to quickly understand,
where, for example, you have free time in your day or where you have
overlapping tasks.  Just a list of tasks is not sufficient.  This
package is created to fix this problem and provide some of the
functionality that modern calendars provide.

There are two major modes provided by the package:

- ~org-timeblock-mode~.  Displays visual schedule (timeblocks) of org
  tasks that are scheduled or have an active timestamp in their body
  (orgmode events) for selected day (Currently, only day view is available).  Available commands:
  - org-timeblock-day-earlier/later ~[C-<down>/<up>]~
  - org-timeblock-set-duration ~[d]~
  - org-timeblock-reschedule ~[s]~
  - org-timeblock-new-task ~[+]~
  - org-timeblock-toggle-timeblock-list ~[t]~
  - org-timeblock-todo ~[1]~
  - org-timeblock-done ~[5]~
  - org-timeblock-switch-view ~[v]~
  - org-timeblock-jump-to-day ~[j]~

- ~org-timeblock-list-mode~.  Displays a list of org tasks that are
  scheduled or orgmode events for selected day.  It's sort of like a
  light org-agenda.  The tasks can be sorted via ~SCHEDULED~ org
  property or manually placed by user via commands
  ~org-timeblock-list-drag-line-forward/backward [M-<up>/<down>]~.  The
  order can be saved in a cache file via ~org-timeblock-list-save
  [C-s]~ command.  The sorting algorithm can be changed via
  ~org-timeblock-list-toggle-sort-function [S]~ command.
  - org-timeblock-list-schedule ~[s]~
  - org-timeblock-list-set-duration ~[d]~
  - org-timeblock-todo ~[1]~
  - org-timeblock-done ~[5]~
  - org-timeblock-list-drag-line-forward/backward ~[M-<down>/<up>]~
  - org-timeblock-list-toggle-sort-function ~[S]~
  - org-timeblock-list-toggle-timeblock ~[t]~
